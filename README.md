# Introduction

## What is this?

This is the mobile part of the LAE big picture! Currently, the PC version of LAE has more features, while the mobile version is lagging behind!

So, we are using the Python Kivy library to develop programs for Android and iOS.

# Development Record

## Development Plan

- Initial Packaging

This took a lot of effort, but I finally completed the packaging! I proudly implemented the "hello world" printing function on the mobile phone ðŸ¥³ It's the first step of a long journey!...

- Feature Development

Gradually align with the features of the PC version. It's particularly important to note that the mobile reminder mechanism will be quite different from that of the PC version.

    - V1.0: Implement custom prompts + reminder times; Reminder method: Can pop up even when the screen is off -- working on it!
